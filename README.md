# Rock-paper-scissors
This is a project that comes from The Odin Project. Learners are tasked with creating a game, utilizing JavaScript primarily and this is the result of the game. 
The project was meant to test the learners understanding of some basic JavaScript concepts such as function scopes, conditional statements and operators, logical statements and debugging using the console.
In the future, this game will be updated especially after learning more about JavaScript concepts such as loops, arrays and objects.
